# SprintPls

SprintPls is a togglesprint mod designed to be actually usable, intuitive, and configurable. It supports a million different colours,
along with a never-before-seen per-character chroma feature, unlike other popular mods which only provide a maximum of one colour per
character.

SprintPls has a movable indicator with configurable text, and is designed to look beautiful in the configuration you want.


## Sounds great. How do I use it?

To get the latest features, you can compile this repository yourself.
You can also check the Releases tab, if there happen to be any new releases that I've compiled specifically for you :)

To compile yourself, you'll need to download this repository (either via `git clone` or, on GitHub, the big green Code button and then the Download button)
Once you've downloaded the repository and possibly extracted it, you'll need to open PowerShell or a Terminal inside the directory.
Then, in your PowerShell or Terminal, type `./gradlew build` and press Enter. Once the build is done, you should see a big text saying `BUILD SUCCESSFUL!`
That means your build was successful. The mod's jarfile will now be available by first going into the `build` directory, then the `libs` directory.
